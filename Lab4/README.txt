Final Delivery of Video Coding Systems
In this final Lab, we present all the methods developed during the course:
- We can find a YUV-RGB converted to change the color space of images
- Another method that defaults downsizes an image by 2 (it would be a possibility to add rate controler in front-end)
- A Serpentine Serial Convertor where you can generate any MxM matrix and convert it.
- An Image Compression Method that compresses rough an image.
- A method to apply run-length encoding to any given array.
- A method to resize a video to given resolutions (by default 1080p and to change it must be done at backend as for a misscomunication between back-front-end we can't manipulate parameters.)
- A method to apply different chroma subsamplings (also the model must be selected in backend, error in frontend to change value)
- A method to see all the hyperparameters and infromation of video files
- A method to divide a video into the first 20 seconds and apply different audio layers into the container.
- A method that tells you how many tracks a video have.
- A method to show the macroblocks and motion vectors of a video.
- A method to Show YUV Histogram of a Video (It isn't working for now)
- A method to convert a video to HVEC, VP8, VP9, h.264 and AV1 (the same as in other methods, it only converts to default format if it isn't changed in the back-end).
- A method to create a Encoding Ladder that isn't working.

For the last exercise of AI usage for most improved tools, we developed a more interactive html file with support of AI, so this would be the contribution.
